I, Dhana Anjana am going to learn python by creating small programs everyday using this repository and storing it here. 
I pledge to contribute atleast 10 minutes everyday to learn and apply atleast 1 concept everyday which will contribute to my growth in this platform. 
I am also willing to share my progress with everyone by making this repository public and using it as a stepping stone towards my progress in python language.
