#print upto n numbers using while loop

while i<=n-1:
    print(i+1)

#Steps 1.Get n, 
# 2.Initialize i as 0, 
# 3.Create while loop with condn. i<=n-1(since we are initialising n as 0), 
# 4.Inside while loop, 4.1.Print i+1, 4.2.Increment i by 1

#print upto n numbers using for loop
for i in range(0,n):
    print(i)
#Steps 1.Get n, 2.Initialise a for loop with range (0,n), 3.Inside for loop, print i

#print even and odd numbers upto n using if condn. and for loop
for i in range(0,n):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i)
print()
for i in range(0,n):

#Steps 1.Get n, 2.Create a for loop with range (0,n), 
# 3. Inside the loop, print i if i modulo 2 is 0 or not for even and odd resp.

#print squares upto n using while loop
i=1
while i<=n:
    print(i*i)
    i+=1
#Steps 1.Get n, 
# 2.Create while loop after initialising a variable i with value 1, 
# 3. Inside while loop, print i*i, 
# 4.Increment i by 1

#Multiplication table of given number upto num
num=int(input("enter number of multiples needed:"))
for i in range(1,num+1):
    print(i*n) #Here, i is incremented value and n is the number whose multiplication table is needed
#Steps 1.Get n, 
# 2.Get number of multiples, 
# 3.Create for loop which has a range of (1,num+1(here remember +1 is important because that value is a stop value))
# 4.print(i*n)
