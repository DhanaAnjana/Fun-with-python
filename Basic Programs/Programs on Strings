#Reverse a string using function
string="HI THIS IS DHANA ANJANA"
list=string.split()
print("List before reversal:",list)
list=list.reverse()
print("List after reversal:",list)
#Steps 1.Create a string with multiple characters, 
# 2.Use the inbuilt fn (string.split()) to split the words in the strings and assign it to a list
# 3.print the list with elements as words in list before reversal
# 4.Reverse the words by using (list.reverse()) and assign the reversed list to the same list
# 5.print the list with reversed elements as list after reversal

#Checking for a palindrome
string=input("enter a string:")
if(string==string[::-1]):
    print(f"{string} is a palindrome")
else:
    print(f"{string} is not a palindrome")
#Steps 1.Get a string from user, 
# 2.Use if condn (string==string[::-1]{uses string slicing to check}), 
# 3.If condn. satisfies, print palindrome, 
# 4.else, print not palindrome

#Count character count in a string
string="Hello World"
count=0
for i in string:
    if i==" ":
        continue
    count+=1
print("No. of characters:",count)
#Steps 1.Assign string with a test string like "hello world", 
# 2.Initialize count variable as 0, 
# 3.Create a for loop which checks each character in string
# 4.Inside for loop, check condn i==" " (for eliminating spaces), if condn. satisfies, continue(skip that character)
# 5.Otherwise, increment count by 1
# 6.Print No. of characters as count

#Replace a character in a string
string="Hello world"
print(string.replace("w","W"))
print(string.replace("Hello","Your"))
string="Welcome to the AIHT"
print(string.replace("e","a"))
print(string.replace("ek","a",3))
#Steps 1.Introduce a string, 2.Use fn string_name.replace("previous char","new char",argument count), 3.Print the result
